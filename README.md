# Exam-4
This Python script is designed specifically to explore DNA sequences. It breaks them down into smaller units called k-mers and analyzes what follows each k-mer. This process is crucial for identifying where sequences overlap, which is fundamental in piecing together complete genomes. The primary function, get_kmers, takes a DNA sequence and a number (k) as inputs. It then generates a list that shows what comes after each k-mer in the sequence. Another function, collect_kmers, extends this capability to handle multiple sequences at once. This is particularly useful when dealing with fragmented genome data, as it aggregates information across all sequences to provide a comprehensive understanding. Additionally, the script includes a function named find_optimal_k, which determines the smallest value for k where every k-mer has only one subsequent k-mer. This optimization streamlines the analysis process, making it simpler and more efficient. The script verifies whether it's being executed from the command line with the right number of arguments. If it is, the script extracts the file path provided as an argument and determines the optimal k for the sequences within that file using the find_optimal_k function. Finally, it displays the optimal k value. This script simplifies the analysis of DNA sequences by identifying the best k value to understand their structure efficiently.
